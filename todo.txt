- robot functions 

1. 2 robot arms, modelled

2. matlab gui to control joint and cartesian movements 

3. estop operation, 2 action resume. no uiwait 
- while loop during robot moving trajectory, while e stop =1, pause. add state to check for e stop =0 and resume button to resume.
- for loop for robot moving trajectory (robot animate?), remove 1 iteration when robot moving to keep in place. 
- set q as current configutation when e stop is pressed?

4. simulated environment . bonus for real robot and augmented sensors 
- grab some assets of groceries off the net, shelves, rails, people, etc. 

5. safety functionality 
- react to asynchronous stop from user e.g. enter unsafe zone
-\when unsafe zone triggered, enploy e stop protocol

- prevent collisions prioritise movement around collision as opposed to detecting and stopping 


- make one robot retreat from safety symbol by second robot using visual servoing and rmrc

6. code repository and code standard adherance 

- bonus: reaction to real RGB-D sensor data 

- bonus: hardware for safety, collision detection, end effector
